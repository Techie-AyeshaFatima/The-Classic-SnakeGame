# The-Classic-SnakeGame
Remember the old <i>Blockade</i> game also known as the snake game?<br>
This program is inspired from the same game.<br>
In this program the input is taken from the user to move the snake around the screen. The player has to use the arrow keys to move the snake. As the snake finds the apple(red dot), it eats the food to grow larger. The Number of apples eaten by the snake is displayed as the score of the game. The game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself. The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before it happens.
